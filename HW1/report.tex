\section*{The MU Puzzle}

The MU Puzzle, introduced in Chapter 1, starts with a very simple setup the axiom string \textbf{MI} and four rules that let us change or extend the string using the letters M, I, and U. The puzzle asks whether it’s possible to reach the string \textbf{MU} by applying these rules.

At first glance it seems like it might work if you just keep trying different combinations, but after some trial and error this problem will not have a solution. The key observation is that no matter what rule you apply, the number of I’s never becomes a multiple of three. It always stays in a certain pattern.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The starting axiom $MI$ has one I.
  \item Rule 1 ($xI \to xIU$) adds a U at the end, but doesn’t change the number of I’s.
  \item Rule 2 ($Mx \to Mxx$) doubles the part after the M, which changes the number of I’s but never makes it a multiple of three.
  \item Rule 3 ($III \to U$) removes three I’s, so the overall pattern stays the same.
  \item Rule 4 ($UU \to$ delete) only affects U’s, not I’s.
\end{itemize}


So the system never produces a string where the number of I’s is a multiple of three. Since $MU$ has zero I’s, it doesn’t fit the pattern, which means there’s no way to reach it from $MI$.

\par
For example, starting with $MI$ (which has 1 I), Rule 1 gives $MIU$. This still has 1 I. If we keep going, $MIU \to MIUIU$ using Rule 2, the number of I’s doubles to 2. At no point does the number of I’s ever become a multiple of three, which is why $MU$ can’t be reached.

\section*{Conclusion}
In the end, the MU puzzle has no solution. The rules simply don’t allow us to create $MU$ starting from $MI$. By spotting the pattern with the I’s, we can prove once and for all that $MU$ is unreachable.
